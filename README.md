TEXT CLASSIFICATION MODEL FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE IDENTIFICATION

# Abstract
In this thesis, the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) models is explored for classifying academic research papers, with a focus on understanding their scientific, societal, or combined purposes. Building on the foundational study by Zhang et al. (2021) on gender differences in research, this work advances two key areas: firstly, the innovative use of a fine-tuned ensemble of BERT models to enhance text classification accuracy across academic documents of varied complexities; Secondly, this thesis significantly expedites text analysis by employing automated text classification techniques. These contributions not only improve the efficiency of processing large datasets but also deepen the understanding of research dynamics, including gender influences. This thesis represents a significant step in harnessing advanced NLP for insightful academic literature analysis, offering valuable tools for academics, policy-makers, and a broader societal understanding of research trends and orientations.
